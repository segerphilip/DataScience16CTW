Summary of the Project
    Who is on the project team?
    - Mackenzie Frackleton and Philip Seger
    What is the main idea of the project?  What is your MVP?  What are your stretch goals?
    - Studying the immunization dataset provided by the CDC. An interest area may be availability of immunizations based on a bunch of different factors (income, area, social level, education of parents, etc.). MVP might be a visualization of where immunizations are most available (on a map of America, for example) in a static map form for a certain year. Strech goal might be an interactive map that you can select which year or different parameters to show specific pain points that affect the data.
    In what way will it change the world?  Why do you care about changing the world in this way?
    - It will educate people about healthcare availability, along with illustrating which areas of America need the most help. The anti-vaccination movement is pretty scary, so showing people where problems exist based on that idea can help show that it is costly. Along with that, we can show how the Affordable Care Act might help/hinder immunization and proper medical care throughout the country.
    What do you want to learn through doing this project?
    - Philip is interested in how we can combine large datasets in a reasonable way and show visualizations that span over multiple datasets. Mackenzie is interested in being able to parse down the huge amounts of information into a reasonable dataset, because some of the data is overkill and will be unneeded.
    Where will you get the data for your project?
    - The CDC has public immunization data available at this link (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files.htm).
    What form will your final deliverable will take?
    - A completed Jupyter notebook consisting of refined models, visualizations, and comments similar to this last project, along with a presentation to an audience concerning what we worked on and what we came up with.

Workflow and Schedule
    What will your workflow be while working on this project?  How will this workflow support successful collaboration with your teammate?
    - Mackenzie and Philip will use different branches to manage version control and collaborative changes. Most likely, they will work together in the same area at the same time to bounce ideas off one another. When a reasonable point is reached (in the sense of it makes sense), the two branches will be merged to master and cleaned properly so there is not too much overlap.
    Where are you planning to be with this project by the mid-project checkin?  (Think about this carefully, I'm going to ask you to report on how this went).
    - We want to show a basic visualization that we worked on. Mainly, we will at this point have selected the most interesting data from the dataset to look into, and cleaned it to a reasonable level that we can work with it later.
    

Assessment
    How should your final deliverable be assessed?  This assessment plan must be specific enough that I can apply it to your final deliverable.
    - Assessment should be based on the final result's quality, along with the presentation's content and presentation. Did we put in effort, did we show what we learned, can others go from our data and learn something useful.
